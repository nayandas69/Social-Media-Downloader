# Contributing to Social Media Downloader

Thank you for your interest in contributing! ðŸ™Œ We welcome all forms of contributions â€” from bug reports and feature ideas to code and documentation.

## Reporting Bugs
1. Search [existing issues](https://github.com/nayandas69/Social-Media-Downloader/issues) to avoid duplicates.
2. If your bug hasnâ€™t been reported, open a new issue using the **Bug Report** template.

## Requesting Features
1. Browse existing feature requests first.
2. Open a new issue using the **Feature Request** template if it's not listed.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Please base all pull requests on the `dev` branch â€” **not** `main`.
- The `main` branch is reserved for stable, production-ready releases.
- Create a feature branch from `dev`, then open a pull request targeting `dev`.

## Making Changes
1. Fork the repository and create a branch for your changes.
2. Follow clean code practices, write helpful commit messages, and include tests/documentation when applicable.
3. Once ready, submit your pull request â€” a maintainer will review and provide feedback.
