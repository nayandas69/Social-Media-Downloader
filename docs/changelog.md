## [1.1.9] - 2025-06-18

## New Platform Support
We added support for more platforms! You can now download videos from:
- `bsky.app`


## New Scripts
> [!IMPORTANT]
> - `install.sh` script for Linux users:  
> - This script will install the package and all dependencies automatically, making it easier for Linux users to get started. That helps you install `ffmpeg` and install Social Media Downloader with a single command & it also have update, uninstall functionality in same script.

Unit tests added for the main functions to ensure reliability and stability of the codebase.

## Fixes & Improvements

- **Fixed**:  
  - Format selection issues in the `download_youtube_or_tiktok_video(url)` function. [#50](https://github.com/nayandas69/Social-Media-Downloader/issues/50)

## [1.1.8] - 2025-05-21

* **New Platform Support**:
  We've added support for even more video platforms! You can now download videos from:

  * `imdb.com`
  * `weibo.com`
  * `dailymotion.com`
  * `tumblr.com`

  Big thanks to the community for the feature requests ‚Äî keep 'em coming!

### Improvements

* **Configuration Loader Overhaul**
  The config loading system has been refactored to:

  * Auto-correct invalid or missing values
  * Validate supported formats and MP3 quality levels
  * Regenerate the config safely if corrupted
  * Log everything clearly to help you debug easily

* **Better Defaults & Validation**
  Now your config won't silently break ‚Äî it heals itself and tells you what was fixed. Nice.

### Fixes

* Fixed occasional crash when using corrupted or incomplete `config.json`
* Corrected path handling for dynamic filenames in downloads
* Ensured `download_directory` is always created safely before use

### Heads Up

* If your config breaks or is outdated, don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî we‚Äôll auto-fix it and log everything clearly.
* Need more formats or platforms? Hit us up!

## [1.1.7] - 2025-05-12

### Fixes & Improvements
- Fixed `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'downloader'` by properly restructuring the project as a Python package (`smd/downloader.py`).
- Updated `pyproject.toml` entry points to:
```toml
  [project.scripts]
  smd = "smd.downloader:main"
  social-media-downloader = "smd.downloader:main"
```

* CLI scripts now work reliably across systems when installed via PyPI.

### How to Upgrade

To upgrade to the latest version, run:

```bash
pip install --upgrade social-media-downloader
```

Then use the CLI tool with:

```bash
smd
# or
social-media-downloader
```

## [1.1.6] - 2025-05-11
### Added
- Support for two new video platforms:
  - SnackVideo (`snackvideo.com`)
  - Kwai (`kwai.com`)

---

## [1.1.5] - 2025-05-10

### Fixes & Improvements
- **Fixed MP3 Quality Handling:**  
  The MP3 quality value (`mp3_quality`) from `config.json` is now properly validated and applied during audio downloads.  
  Previously, entering custom qualities like `256` or `396` wouldn't work correctly due to a bug ‚Äî it's now fixed.

- **Corrected Format Selection Logic:**  
  The audio download process now correctly respects the selected `mp3_quality` value (e.g., 128, 192, 256, 320, 396) instead of defaulting silently or failing.

- **Stronger Validation:**  
  If an invalid `mp3_quality` value is provided (e.g., `60`), the app will fall back to the default `192` and show a warning in the logs.

### Config Updates
- The `config.json` now supports and validates the following MP3 qualities:  
  `64`, `128`, `192`, `256`, `320`, `396`.
