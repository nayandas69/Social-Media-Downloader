## 🛠️ Requirements

### 📌 **FFmpeg is REQUIRED**
If you want **audio & video together**, you **MUST** install FFmpeg.

#### 🛠️ How to Install FFmpeg:

### **Windows**
1. Download FFmpeg from [here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
2. Extract & add it to your system **PATH**

### **macOS/Linux**
```sh
sudo apt install ffmpeg  # Debian/Ubuntu
brew install ffmpeg  # macOS (Homebrew)
yum install ffmpeg  # CentOS/RHEL
```

Without FFmpeg, **some downloads will be video-only with no sound** (which sucks 😬).
